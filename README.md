# tasit

Tasit is a suite of mobile apps for mainstream users that lets them use popular dapps.

In the short run, the focus for the Tasit products is providing simple, third-party clients for popular dapps. The Tasit apps will provide (a) more delightful UX for particular features of the dapp (for example, sell your CryptoKitty with no fee through a beautiful UI) and in some cases (b) ancillary features for the dapp.

We have a separate app for each major class of dapp.

### Tasit Decentraland

Our first app is called `Tasit Decentraland`.

Decentraland is a dapp using [unique tokens / NFTs](http://erc721.org/). `Tasit Decentraland` lets you use that dapp on mobile.

This is the first Tasit NFT app - we plan to release other similar 3rd-party apps for other popular NFT projects.

Here's an [interactive wireframe video](https://youtu.be/iJQtDPQrRsE) showing how this app will look for an example ERC721 NFT like [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/).

This app shows off the major functionality of the [Tasit SDK](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK).

##### ...with more to come

### The road ahead

In the long run, Tasit will stitch together components from multiple dapps into novel experiences, like delegating your vote for a particular TCR to a preexisting Aragon organization, or decorating your Dharma loans with the same hats you use for your CryptoKitties because...reasons?

### Developers

This is a monorepo for all of the open-source Tasit 3rd-party mobile apps for Ethereum dapps

These apps all use the [Tasit SDK](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK).
