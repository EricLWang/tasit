# tasit

A monorepo for all of the open source Tasit 3rd party mobile apps for Ethereum dapps

In the short run, the focus for the Tasit products is providing simple, third-party clients for viral dapps. Tasit will provide (a) more delightful UX for particular features of the dapp (for example, sell your CryptoKitty with no fee through a beautiful UI) and in some cases (b) ancillary features for the dapp.

We have a separate app for each major class of dapp.

    Tasit Nifty (NFTs)
    Tasit List (TCRs / FCRs)
    Tasit Org (DAOs)
    Tasit Market (Two-sided marketplaces)
    ...with more to come

In the long run, Tasit will stitch together components from multiple dapps into novel experiences, like delegating your vote for a particular TCR to a preexisting Aragon organization, or decorating your Dharma loans with the same hats you use for your CryptoKitties because...reasons?
