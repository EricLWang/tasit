# tasit

Tasit is a suite of mobile apps for mainstream users that lets them use popular dapps.

In the short run, the focus for the Tasit products is providing simple, third-party clients for popular dapps. The Tasit apps will provide (a) more delightful UX for particular features of the dapp (for example, sell your CryptoKitty with no fee through a beautiful UI) and in some cases (b) ancillary features for the dapp.

We have a separate app for each major class of dapp.

- Tasit One ([NFTs](http://erc721.org/))

- Tasit List ([TCRs](https://medium.com/@simondlr/city-walls-bo-taoshi-exploring-the-power-of-token-curated-registries-588f208c17d5) / FCRs)

- Tasit Org ([DAOs](https://blog.aragon.org/bringing-daos-back-aragon-monthly-92756cb65639/))

- Tasit Market (Two-sided marketplaces like Gitcoin, CryptoCribs, Ethlance, etc.)

- ...with more to come

In the long run, Tasit will stitch together components from multiple dapps into novel experiences, like delegating your vote for a particular TCR to a preexisting Aragon organization, or decorating your Dharma loans with the same hats you use for your CryptoKitties because...reasons?
